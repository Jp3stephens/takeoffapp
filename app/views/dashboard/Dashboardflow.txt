Okay here is how I want the flow to work 

--> Load the dashboard
    - Check the DB for projects and project status
    - If no projects, show create new project view 
    - If projects, show list view with projects and status

    - If create new project is clicked, show project view (dashboard has overview, documents, takeoff, estimating, bid)
    - In overview:  Enter descriptions about project (name, due date, sf, project number, description, etc...)
    - In documents: Button to upload documents (show in list format?)
     - In takeoff (Do takeoff, for now, just measurement tool (SF and LF))
     - In estimating, add up takeoff measurements 
     - In bid, WIP
